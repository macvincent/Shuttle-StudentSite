# CUTransit

This prototype was completed as part of a class project for my CSCI 438, System Analysis and Design class. The web app that is able to authenticate and incorporate user info, show the users current position, display the position of active buses and bus stops, and on request, give a passenger information on their walking distance to the next bus stop and the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of a bus at that station. You can access the prototype, which is hosted as a Node.js service on Heroku, using this [link](https://campus-shuttle.herokuapp.com/).
